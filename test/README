jun_CC: packages to caluclate NCF
I, code needed:
   a, meed2sac
   b, FetchData
II, script:
   do_CC.bash      !this script call each code to do ambient noise processing of each step
   how to run  ?
   bash do_CC.bash station.lst 2009 1 2009 2
III, file needed:
   1, for_cc       ! paramter file 
   2, station.lst  ! station list
IV, parameter file format:
LHZ 1              (componenet name, number; if larger than 1, component show be like LH )
0 86400 0          (seed typei 0 for miniseed, length of record in seconds, overlapping percentage %)
0.001 0.2 1 0      (low and high corner frequency in the response removement, remove response 1 or not 0, decimate 1 or not 0) 
seed               (directory of the seed)
resp               (directory of the response)
mdat               (directory of the station information)
SAC                (directory of the SAC file)
SAC                (directory of the cut SAC file, just set it as the same as previous if cut not applied)
0.01 0.2 0.02 0.2  (corner frequency of earthquake, corner frequency of target signal)
0 1 1              (do one bit 1 or not 0, do time domain normalisation 1 or not 0, do frequency domain whittening) attention: just use one type of time domain normalisation
90 500             (percentage of SAC file used, number of points in each lag of NCF)
CC                 (directory of the out put NCF)
